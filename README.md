<h1>ARP Spoofing Detector</h1>



<h2>Description of the project</h2>
Public networks are getting dangerous to use, as malicious users can intercept the network when
the user is sending and receiving packets from a default gateway. There are many consequences
when the attacker can spoof packets, as it can hold sensitive data . This cyber attack is called Man
in the Middle attack, to be exact, is called ARP spoofing attack, where the attacker tricks the
default gateway to believing they are the user by using MAC and IP address.
